# 1. Erlang/Elixir

## Hej Erlang!

* Created by Ericsson, a Swedish telecom company
* Designed with reliability, responsiveness, scalability, and
  availability as main points of emphasis
* Consists of the language, virtual machine, framework, and tools
* Used by WhatsApp, Heroku, Chef, RabbitMQ, financial systems,
  multiplayer games

Example: Ericsson's communication system supports millions of
users/phone calls. One dropped phone call or impacted area cannot
bring the entire system down. Updating the system should not
disconnect calls in progress.

---

## Hello Elixir!

* Open source project created by Jose Valim
* Abstracts away Erlang boilerplate
* Has cleaner and more compact syntax than Erlang
* Compiles to bytecode run on Erlang virtual machine

---

## Example: Adding two numbers in Erlang

```erlang
-module(sum_server).
-behaviour(gen_server).

-export([
  start/0, sum/3,
  init/1, handle_call/3, handle_cast/2, handle_info/2, terminate/2,
  code_change/3
])

start() -> gen_server:start(?MODULE, [], []).
sum(Server, A, B) -> gen_server:call(Server, {sum, A, B}).
init(_) -> {ok, undefined}.
handle_call({sum, A, B}, _From, State) -> {reply, A + B, State}.
handle_cast(_Msg, State) -> {noreply, State}.
handle_info(_Info, State) -> {noreply, State}.
terminate(_Reason, _State) -> ok.
code_change(_OldVsn, State, _Extra) -> {ok, State}.
```

---

## Example: Adding two numbers in Elixir

```elixir
defmodule SumServer do
  use GenServer

  def start do
    GenServer.start(__MODULE__, nil)
  end

  def sum(server, a, b) do
    GenServer.call(server, {:sum, a, b})
  end

  def handle_call({:sum, a, b}, _from, state) do
    {:reply, a + b, state}
  end
end

server = SumServer.start
SumServer.sum(server, 1, 1) # 2
```

## OOP

Most people embarking on their programming journey are likely to start by
learning OOP. **Activity:** *Survey audience first language*

Starting from raw procedural code we often develop in this manner:

* Brute force blobs of code to accomplish some tasks
* Analyze and extract classes
* Specify data attributes
* Add behavior by exposing public methods
* Replace code blobs by instantiating objects with initial state and
then calling methods on the objects to get some return value and/or
cause side effects

In OOP, we model the real world using classes, create objects that hold
state, and change the world by calling methods on objects.

---

## FP

An alternate approach is FP. Instead of emphasizing objects, the main focus
is on **data** and how to transform it.

A FP development workflow:

* Brute force blobs of code to accomplish some tasks
* Analyze and extract **pure** functions
* Always return new copies of data when changing data (data is **immutable**)
* Replace code blobs with function call chains

Because functions are written to be pure and isolated, each function can
arguably be more easily understood in the absence of side effects.
What else does FP offer us?

## Which one is better?

* This is a trap question and out of scope for this talk. There is way too
much information to even attempt analyzing. From what I've read, it seems
to be a pretty controversial topic, full of spicy drama. Below are
some links to FP discussions:

* [The main benefits of FP](https://www.quora.com/What-is-so-great-about-functional-programming-What-are-the-main-points-of-it-and-why-are-they-useful)
* [Why isn't FP more popular?](https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-functional-programming-that-popular-even-though-its-so-beneficial)

# 3. Immutability & Concurrency

## Immutability

The biggest "gotcha" in transitioning from OOP to FP is the concept of
immutability and how it affects shared state. The following compares
adding a task to a todo list in Ruby and Elixir.

---

## Todo list in Ruby

```ruby
class TodoList
  TodoItem = Struct.new(:date, :title)

  attr_reader :entries

  def initialize
    @auto_id = 1
    @entries = {}
  end

  def add_entry(date, title)
    entries[@auto_id] = TodoItem.new(date, title)
    @auto_id += 1
    entries
  end
end

list = TodoList.new
list.entries # {}
list.add_entry(Time.now, 'Walk dog')
```

---

## Todo list in Elixir

```elixir
defmodule TodoList do
  defstruct auto_id: 1, entries: %{}

  def new(), do: %TodoList{}

  def add_entry(list, entry = %{date: _, title: _}) do
    entry = Map.put(entry, :id, list.auto_id)
    new_entries = Map.put(list.entries, list.auto_id, entry)

    %TodoList{list | auto_id: list.auto_id + 1, entries: new_entries}
  end

  def entries(list) do
    list.entries
    |> Enum.map(fn({_, entry}) ->
      %{date: entry.date, title: entry.title}
    end)
  end
end

list = TodoList.new
TodoList.entries(list) # %{}
todo = %{date: ~D[2019-10-01], title: "Walk dog"}
list = TodoList.add_entry(list, todo)
TodoList.entries(list)
```

---

## Comparing Todo list implementations

The Elixir version is more verbose, both in its definition of the `TodoList`
module, as well as its usage! `TodoList.add_entry/2` takes `list` and
`entry` arguments and returns a **brand new** `TodoList`.  The return value for
`TodoList.add_entry/2` is saved by reassigning `list`. Since data is
immutable, each new state is saved to a variable if it needs to be used later.

---

## So what benefits does immutability give us?

* Promotes pure functions - easy to reason about, simple to test
* Minimizes the effects of invalid state - data transformed by
multiple functions still exists in its original form (rollbacks for
data!)
* Efficient memory management - new copies of data reuse as much of
the old data as possible, only making shallow copies when needed
* Prevents mutation of shared state - key point for **concurrency**

---

## Concurrency

[Concurrency](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050222/what-is-the-difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism)
is multitasking. It is not the same as parallelism, which is doing multiple
tasks at the same time. Concurrent tasks can be executed, interrupted, and
finished in overlapping time.

implemented.

# 4. Recursion

## What happened to iteration?

* We often use iteration to loop through collections and perform work
* Though Elixir doesn't have loops... ðŸ˜°, it has lots of fun though...
* We can use higher-order functions to abstract away recursive functions

```elixir
defmodule Fun do
  def so_fun(count) when count > 0 do
    1..count |> Enum.map(fn(_) -> "SO FUN" end) |> Enum.join(" ")
  end

  def very_fun(count) when count > 0 do
    (for _ <- 1..count, into: [], do: "VERY FUN") |> Enum.join(" ")
  end

  def super_fun(count) when count > 0 do
    do_fun(count, [])
  end

  defp do_fun(0, result), do: Enum.join(result, " ")

  defp do_fun(count, result) do
    do_fun(count - 1, ["SUPER FUN" | result])
  end
end
```

`Fun.so_fun/1` uses the pipe operator `|>` to transform data via
chained function calls, it is similar to Unix piping `|`. `Fun.super_fun/1`
uses a feature called **comprehensions** that uses syntactic sugar to give
us an iteration-like mechanism.`Fun.very_fun/1` uses recursion,
multi-clause functions, and pattern matching.

---

## Higher-order functions in Elixir

Elixir has an `Enumerable` module used to iterate through collections.
`Enumerable.map/2` iterates through the collection and yields each member
to the callback function. The source code is below:

```elixir
def map(enumerable, fun) do
  reducer = fn x, acc -> {:cont, [fun.(x) | acc]} end
  Enumerable.reduce(enumerable, {:cont, []}, reducer) |> elem(1) |> :lists.reverse()
end
```

`reducer` returns a tuple containing two elements, an **atom** that tells
Elixir to **continue** iterating through the collection,
and a list that accumulates the result of the input function `fun` being
called on the current input `x`.

The actual work is done by `Enumerable.reduce/3`, written as a
**multi-clause function**, a common pattern in Elixir. **Pattern
matching** is another often used tool in Elixir. Here, it matches against
the input arguments to determine which function to call. The order in
which the clauses are defined matters, Elixir matches clauses from top to bottom.

```elixir
def reduce(_list, {:halt, acc}, _fun), do: {:halted, acc}
def reduce(list, {:suspend, acc}, fun), do: {:suspended, acc, &reduce(list, &1, fun)}
def reduce([], {:cont, acc}, _fun), do: {:done, acc}
def reduce([head | tail], {:cont, acc}, fun), do: reduce(tail, fun.(head, acc), fun)
```

Let's walk through the last two clauses:

1. Is the input collection empty (`[]`)? Return `{:done, acc}`, meaning
that the execution is done, and the result is `acc`. Stop execution!
2. The input collection is not empty. Use pattern matching and the cons
`|` operator to save the first member to `head` and the rest to `tail`.
The cons operator is like `unshift` in Ruby and JavaScript.
3. Continue breaking the problem down by calling the same function with
new arguments. Go back to step 1.

Now you've seen how Elixir uses a combination of recursion, multi-clause
functions, and pattern matching to circumvent immutability and the
absence of iteration. Recursive thinking can be considered another big
adjustment coming from OOP to FP, for more information and practice,

## Fibonacci Demo

```elixir
defmodule SimpleFibonacci do
  def nth_term(n) when n > 0 do
    do_fib(n)
  end

  defp do_fib(1), do: 0

  defp do_fib(2), do: 1

  defp do_fib(n) do
    do_fib(n - 1) + do_fib(n - 2)
  end
end
```

`SimpleFibonacci` is a reasonable first attempt at deriving the nth
Fibonacci number. It reads exactly like the mathematical definition. The
issue with this approach is it will be very slow for larger Fibonacci
numbers. For each call of `do_fib(n)` there are *two* recursive calls!
Let's count the number of function calls (shortened to f()):

| Function Calls                                           | Function Count | Big O                   |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| f(1)                                                     | 1              | O(1)                    |
| f(2)                                                     | 1              | O(1)                    |
| f(3), f(2) + f(1)                                        | 3              | O(n)                    |
| f(4), f(3) + f(2), f(2) + f(1)                           | 5              | O(n)                    |
| f(5), f(4) + f(3), f(3) + f(2), f(2) + f(1), f(2) + f(1) | 9              | O(n)                    |
| f(6) (omitted)                                           | 15             | O(n)                    |
| f(7) (omitted)                                           | 25             | O(n)                    |
| f(8) (omitted)                                           | 41             | O(n)                    |
| f(9) (omitted)                                           | 67             | O(n)                    |
| f(10) (omitted)                                          | 109            | O(<sup>2</sup>) YIKES! |

```elixir
defmodule FastFibonacci do
  def nth_term(n) when n > 0 do
    find(n, 0, 1)
  end

  defp find(1, _, result), do: result

  defp find(n, acc, result) do
    find(n - 1, result, result + acc)
  end
end
```

`FastFibonacci` uses [tail call
optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) resulting in a more
performant solution. Worst case time complexity is O(n). One interesting
thing that Elixir does for tail calls is it does not push another stack
frame (stack level too deep LOL) for tail calls. It instead performs a
"jump statement", so there is no additional memory penalty incurred.

# 5. Concurrency in Elixir/Erlang

The basic concurrency primitive is called an Erlang process. It is not
related at all to CPU processes or threads. Erlang processes are super
light-weight, typical Erlang systems often run thousands or millions of
Erlang processes.

In a typical scenario, the BEAM (the Erlang virtual machine) runs inside
one OS process and has a number schedulers each running in a thread equal
to the number of CPU cores. The schedulers efficiently manage running
processes, allowing work to be done concurrently and in parallel.

## Fibonacci List Demo

```elixir
defmodule Fibonacci do
  def next_after(target) do
    find_next(target, 1, 0, 1)
  end

  defp find_next(target, _term_count, _acc, next) when next > target do
    next
  end

  defp find_next(target, term_count, acc, next) do
    find_next(target, term_count + 1, next, next + acc)
  end
end

defmodule NextFibonacci do
  def run(list) do
    Enum.map(list, fn(num) ->
      run_concurrently(self(), num)
      receive do
        {:ok, next} -> next
      end
    end)
  end

  defp run_concurrently(caller, number) do
    spawn(fn ->
      send(caller, {:ok, Fibonacci.next_after(number)})
    end)
  end
end
```
