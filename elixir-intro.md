# Scope

Let's learn a bit about Elixir and why how it puts the *fun* in
functional programming!

Today I plan on covering:

1. Background of Erlang and Elixir
2. Explain functional vs imperative programming
3. What is the big deal about immutability and concurrency?
4. How is recursion utilized in functional programming?
5. Compare concurrency primitives of various languages
