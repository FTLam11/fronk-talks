Disclaimer: This talk is aimed towards the development of web/mobile
applications used by external users. Thus, testing of frameworks and
libraries is not a concern for these talks.

These series of talks may contain coarse or crude language. This program

## Whom does testing involve?

Potentially anyone but the user! Users gives precisely zero
fucks. Why would a user care about how well tested the application is?

## Elephant in the room

1. As a software agency, we help customers solve their business
   problems. Our customers compensate us with money.
2. We write code to solve business problems, BUT writing code costs
   money and time. The more we write, the more money and time we spend.
3. Business problems change. Thus, code must change. Change costs time
   and money. How quickly can we adapt and change our code?

How does a business grow and develop? By delivering solutions
with as less resources. In an ideal world, we could ignore tests
by writing perfect code. This is impossible! If it was possible
we'd all be living off the phat of the land.
